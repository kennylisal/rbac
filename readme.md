# RABC

A lightweight and flexible Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) library for Node.js, written in TypeScript. This library enables developers to manage user permissions and roles with support for role inheritance and dynamic attribute-based constraints. It provides a clean API for checking permissions, validating attributes, and integrating with custom data sources through an abstract Provider class.

This is a simple RABC implementation built with typescript with inention to be made as a library for other projects. This module is not dependent on an authentication, a user session, or a datastore system.
**This Project is still ongoing**
